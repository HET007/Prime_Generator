This Prime Number Genrator is build on java language

Using Eclips IDE 

The Prime Folder contain src folder in that you can see .java file using wich you can easly run code by java compiler. 

however for more accuracy you may import this project into eclips IDE,

For passing the arguments you may  --> Runconfigure in IDE in that there is one argument section is there 
you simply have to pass arguments there for commmand line arguments.

it depends on to the user to add command line data or not so if user doesn't enter data at commmand line code will
.call method name getData() which will intialise the data from user.

there are types of methods to find prime factors,

First : if the number is devided by it self and not by any it'll consider as prime number.

Second : find the squre root of the number Given and devide start deviding with 2 to till the result of squre root 
	 it'll reduce the excicution time because of small factors however this method took place as efficent when the 
	 higher number of primes you have to find i.e 1 to 1000 it'll work at that time efficently
